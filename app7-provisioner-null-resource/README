Terraform Provisioners are used for executing scripts or shell commands on a local or remote machine 
as part of resource creation/deletion. They are similar to â€œEC2 instance user data
Terraform provisioners are of three types -

file
local-exec
remote-exec
1.File provisioner - The file provisioner will help you to copy the file securely from the local machine or development machine to the remote Ec2 instance.

Local provisioner - The local-exec provisioner invokes a local executable after a resource is created. This invokes a process on the machine running Terraform, not on the resource. It will help you to run the shell command onto your local machine instead of the remote EC2 instance. The local provisioners are

Remote provisioner - The remote-exec provisioner invokes a script on a remote resource after it is created. This can be used to run a configuration management tool, bootstrap into a cluster, etc. It will help you to run the shell command onto the remote Ec2 instance of AWS or virtual machine of Google Cloud
